**Market**

The market tab displays loan requests submitted by other users. Users can also make their own loan requests from this page.

Loan requests are made up of several key pieces of information:

* Term (duration) of the loan
* Asset to be loaned, and the amount of that asset that is being requested. This is also displayed in USD value.
* Asset(s) to be used as collateral, and the amount of that asset(s) that is being collateralized. This is also displayed in USD value.
* Health ratio of the value of the collateral compared to the value of the loan requested
* Percentage of the loan request amount that is being offered as interest. This is also displayed as an APR based on the duration of the loan.
* Asset and the amount of that asset that will be paid as interest.

Users searching for loan requests to find can hide under-collateralized loan requests that have a health ratio of less than 100%. Additionally, users can sort loans by:

* Date requested
* Loan amount
* Interest percentage
* Health ratio
* Term length
* APR amount
