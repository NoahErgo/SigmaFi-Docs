# Fulfilling Loan Requests

Before filling a loan request, lenders should consider a few assumptions:

* In comparison to the loan amount, is the collateral healthy enough to feel comfortable if the borrower fails to repay the loan?
* If the borrower fails to repay the loan, will the collateral maintain its value over the course of the loan term?
* If the collateral is a staking key, vesting key, or some token derivative, can you verify that the collateral being offered is actually backed by something of real value?
* If the term length is a long period of time, will you feel comfortable being separated from the lent funds for that period of time? Will you need those funds at any point during the term?
* Lenders can view the address from which the loan originates. Is there any suspicious activity in that address that may result in failure to repay the loan?

If lenders feel comfortable with all of these considerations and still wish to fund their loan, they will be charged a small service fee when they confirm their loan.
