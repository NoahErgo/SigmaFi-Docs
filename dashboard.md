**Dashboard**

On the dashboard tab, lenders and borrowers can monitor their open loan request orders, active loans, and active debits.

**Open orders**

In the open orders sub-tab, borrowers can monitor their loan requests that have not yet been funded. Additionally, they can cancel the order or fund their own loan request if they wish to do so.

**Loans**

In the loans sub-tab, lenders can monitor the active loans that are awaiting repayment from their borrowers. The repayment amount is displayed with interest included and the borrower’s address is linked to allow the lender to monitor activity within the borrower’s address.

Most importantly, the term of each active loan can be monitored and tracked. If repayment is not completed prior to the end of the term length, the lender can choose to liquidate the collateral used to create the loan request. Lenders are not forced to liquidate the loan - the collateral will sit until either the loan is repaid, or it is liquidated by the lender. Lenders should consider risks associated with storage rent if the collateral sits dormant for several years waiting to be liquidated.

**Debits**

In the debits sub-tab, borrowers can monitor the active loans that they need to repay. Here borrowers can track the remaining time left on their active loans to monitor repayment urgency and avoid liquidation. The repayment amount is displayed with interest included and the lender’s address is linked to allow the borrower to monitor activity within the lender’s address.

If borrower’s fail or choose not to repay their loan before the term ends, the collateral shown is subject to liquidation from the lender.
